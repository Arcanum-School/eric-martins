>A guide for Eric Martins to learn how to be an Arcanum Web Developer :p

## Introduction

This is a guide for my friend Eric Martins learn how to be an Arcanum Web Developer. In other words, how to be an web developer the right way.

I created a learning chronogram for him. For each topic chronogram I'll write a post on my [blog](http://danilovaz.github.io) and update the topic in CHRONOGRAM.md file with the link to the post.

Weekly I will create 5 questions related to topics that he learned during the week. The questions will be posted by me in QUESTIONS.md and answered by Eric.

The chronogram is not closed, so if you want to suggest a topic, please open an issue and let me know :)
